# Input output streams
Viewed such topics as charsets, `InputStream`, `OutputStream`, `Reader`, `Writer`, adapters, decorators, serialization, file system.
## Completed tasks
### 1. Delete zero
Using finite state machine, write a program that removes all zeros from specified
sequence. If there are several zeros in a row, program should delete them for
once.
### 2. Entity input output stream
Write a program that implements adapter from `EntityOutputStream` to `OutputStream` and from `EntityInputStream` to `InputStream` for specified entity.
### 3. Byte array output stream
Write a program that implements  `ByteArrayOutputStream`. Creation of additional buffer takes place using specified strategy. This implementation must have methods for writing one byte and byte array. When writing large byte array, choose optimal strategy for allocating new buffers.
### 4. File system
Write a program that
1) finds files and directories with specified parameters;
2) copies content of one directory to another.
